# Geh Calculation

In ancient Persia, the idea of time was relatively higher-level due to the lack
of modern time technologies.  So, the day was split apart into five different sections as described below.

The purpose of this application is to make it easy for people to understand what Gah it is where ever they are.

The app will have a function that takes in the _Current Location_ as a parameter and returns the current Gah.

| Gah          | Time Range          | Dedicated To |
| ------------ | :-----------------: | -----------: |
| Havan        | Sunrise to noon     | Mithra       |
| Rapithwan    | Noon to 3 p.m.      | Warmth       |
| Uziran       | 3 p.m. to sunset    | Apam-Napat   |
| Aiwisruthrem | Sunset to midnight  | Fravashis    |
| Ushahin      | Midnight to sunrise | Sarosh       |
